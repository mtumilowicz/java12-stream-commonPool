## preface

* https://github.com/mtumilowicz/java11-spliterator-forkjoin
* `ForkJoinPool` - `ExecutorService` for running `ForkJoinTasks`
    * is used by any `ForkJoinTask` that is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool
* `ForkJoinTask` - is a thread-like entity that is much lighter weight than a normal thread
    * is a lightweight form of `Future`
    * computational task calculating pure functions or operating on purely isolated objects
    * primary coordination mechanisms are 
        * `fork` - arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the current task is running 
                       in, if applicable, or using the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` if not in `ForkJoinPool`
        * `join` - doesn't proceed until the task's result has been computed

## project description
* common `ForkJoinPool` supports parallel streams and `CompletableFuture`
* common pool is common for the whole application, so there is possibility of saturation
* common pool size vs available processors
    ```
    given:
    def processors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()
    def poolSize = ForkJoinPool.commonPool().parallelism

    expect: 'differs at 1 thread, main'
    processors - 1 == poolSize
    ```
* parallel - using fork-join pool
    ```
    given:
    def nums = 1..10

    when:
    def threads = nums.stream()
            .parallel()
            .map { extractThreads() }
            .collect Collectors.toSet()
    
    then:
    println threads
    ```
    produces (on my pc):
    ```
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7,5,main]
    Thread[Test worker,5,main] // note that main thread interferes
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-13,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-11,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-9,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-15,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3,5,main]
    ```
* drawbacks of mixing threads from a pool with a submitting thread:
    * http://coopsoft.com/ar/Calamity2Article.html#submit
    * submitting threadâ€™s stack is contaminated with work that should be independent of it
    * this practice violates a fundamental principle of good programming in not separating a caller from the 
    external processing
* `-Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=100`
* we could run stream on a dedicated thread pool
    ```
    given:
    def nums = 1..10
  
    and:
    def stream = nums.stream()
            .parallel()
            .map { printThreads() }
    
    when:
    process(stream) // it doesn't really matter where you create the stream but where you invoke terminal operation
