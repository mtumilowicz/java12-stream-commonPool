## preface
* https://github.com/mtumilowicz/fork-join-find-minimum
* https://github.com/mtumilowicz/java11-spliterator-forkjoin
* `ForkJoinPool` - `ExecutorService` for running `ForkJoinTasks`
    * is used by any `ForkJoinTask` that is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool
* `ForkJoinTask` - is a thread-like entity that is much lighter weight than a normal thread
    * is a lightweight form of `Future`
    * computational task calculating pure functions or operating on purely isolated objects
    * primary coordination mechanisms are 
        * `fork` - arranges to asynchronously execute this task in the pool the current task is running 
                       in, if applicable, or using the `ForkJoinPool.commonPool()` if not in `ForkJoinPool`
        * `join` - doesn't proceed until the task's result has been computed

## project description
* common `ForkJoinPool` supports parallel streams and `CompletableFuture`
* common pool is common for the whole application, so there is possibility of saturation
* common pool size vs available processors
    ```
    given:
    def processors = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()
    def poolSize = ForkJoinPool.commonPool().parallelism

    expect: 'differs at 1 thread, submitting thread'
    processors - 1 == poolSize
    ```
* parallel - using fork-join pool
    ```
    given:
    def nums = 1..10

    when:
    def threads = nums.stream()
            .parallel()
            .map { extractThreads() }
            .collect Collectors.toSet()
    
    then: 'on my pc'
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-7,5,main]
    Thread[Test worker,5,main] // note that submitting thread interferes
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-13,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-11,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-9,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-5,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-15,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool.commonPool-worker-3,5,main]
    ```
* drawbacks of mixing threads from a pool with a submitting thread:
    * http://coopsoft.com/ar/Calamity2Article.html#submit
    * submitting threadâ€™s stack is contaminated with work that should be independent of it
    * this practice violates a fundamental principle of good programming in not separating a caller from the 
    external processing
* `-Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=100`
* we could run stream on a dedicated thread pool
    ```
    given:
    def nums = 1..10
  
    and:
    def stream = nums.stream()
            .parallel()
            .map { printThreads() }
    
    when:
    process(stream) // it doesn't really matter where you create the stream but where you invoke terminal operation
  
    then: 'on my pc'
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-101,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-17,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-59,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-73,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-45,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-75,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-87,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-89,5,main]
    Thread[ForkJoinPool-1-worker-117,5,main]
    ```
    where:
    ```
    static void process(stream) throws InterruptedException {
        def pool = new ForkJoinPool(50)
        pool.submit { stream.forEach {} }
        pool.shutdown()
        pool.awaitTermination(30, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
    }
    ```
    note that:
    > Note, however, that this technique of submitting a task to a fork-join pool to run the parallel stream in that pool is an implementation "trick" and is not guaranteed to work. Indeed, the threads or thread pool that is used for execution of parallel streams is unspecified. By default, the common fork-join pool is used, but in different environments, different thread pools might end up being used. (Consider a container within an application server.)
